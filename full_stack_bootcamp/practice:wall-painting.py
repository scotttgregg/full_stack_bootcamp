# practice/wall-painting.py

# All our friends are re-painting one wall of their rooms.
# They want us to figure out how much itâ€™s going to cost.
# Assume one gallon of paint covers 400 square feet.
#
# Ask the user for:
#
# Width of the wall
# Height of the wall
# How much a gallon of paint costs
# Figure out then print how much it will cost to paint the wall with one coat.
#
# wall_width = int(input('What is the width of the wall (in feet)? \n'))
# wall_height = int(input('What is the height of the wall (in feet)? \n'))
# paint_cost = int(input('How much does a gallon of paint cost? \n'))
# coats = int(input('How many coats of paint do you plan to put on?\n'))
#
# square_feet = wall_width * wall_height
#
# print('Your wall is ' + str(square_feet) + 'sq ft.')
#
# cost_per_sqft = paint_cost / 400
#
# total_cost = cost_per_sqft * square_feet * coats

# print('It will cost ' + str(total_cost) + ' dollars to paint your wall.')
